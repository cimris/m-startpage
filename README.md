#Startpage

Created a custom browser startpage for fun. I am a fan of pixelart, as well as a terminal look, so I tried to combine these design ideas together. I'll likely continue to update this as I keep learning and thinking of fun ideas to add.

Last Update: 4/12/21

Details
-Font and Colorscheme was created referencing the [Firefox Design Docs.](https://design.firefox.com/photon/visuals/color.html#red)
-I lost the sources on many of the gifs in the files. My apologies to any creators, and if you know the sources, let me know and I will attribute them.

TODO
-Add randomly chosen image on load.
-Change blinking area into working search bar.
-Add further details such as user placeholder pulling from Profile Name, Location Weather, and AQI.
