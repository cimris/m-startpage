# Startpage

Created a custom browser startpage for fun. I am a fan of pixelart, as well as a terminal look, so I tried to combine these design ideas together. This project also gave me an excuse to use CSS Grid finally, as I have mostly used Flexbox since I have started. I'll likely continue to update this as I keep learning and thinking of fun ideas to add.
