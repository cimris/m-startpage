# STARTPAGE

Created a custom browser startpage for fun. I am a fan of pixelart, as well as a terminal look, so I tried to combine these design ideas together. This project also gave me an excuse to use CSS Grid finally, as I have mostly used Flexbox since I have started. I'll likely continue to update this as I keep learning and thinking of fun ideas to add.

### FINAL UPDATE

This is the final update for this startpage. When I started this, I had a rather poor design process - which I later improved through other projects. However, it did achieve it's goal in helping me test some concepts I was learning at the time such as grids and randomized arrays.

I will likely make a new Startpage later more inspired by [Bento](https://github.com/migueravila/Bento), [nightTab](https://github.com/zombieFox/nightTab), [Bonjourr](https://github.com/victrme/Bonjourr), and some other designs I have seen on [r/startpages](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages/).
